Terraform module to provision a secure terraform state bucket for team use of IAC.

---

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

## Versions

| Terraform Version | Statebucket Release |
| :---------------: | :-----------------: |
|      0.12.x       |        0.3.0        |
|      0.11.x       |       0.2.25        |

## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing Terraform code:

```HCL
module statebucket {
  source      = "JamesWoolfenden/statebucket/aws"
  version     = "0.3.1"
  common_tags = var.common_tags
}
```

Set-up as per example.

Use the generated `remote_state.tf` and change the bucket key for each subsequent service as required

```hcl
terraform {
...

  backend "s3" {
    ...

    key = "<your-service>/<provider-service>/terraform.tfstate"
    ...
  }
}
```

# Instructions

When working with Terraform as part of a team, instead of a local **terraform.tfstate** file, a shared remote state store is required, for AWS this is a S3 bucket.
But if we want to automate everything via Terraform?
Traditionally we would have to create the initial bucket by hand via the console or by the cli and the resource unmanaged.
The module and example solves the issue of creating a state bucket in Terraform using Terraform itself.

## Chicken then Egg

The Makefile in folder _examples\examplesA_ has a number of tasks, one specifically to create the initial bucket:

```sh
make first
```

This makes the lock DB table, the state (S3) bucket, fills out and creates the remote_state.tf file and then copies the state from the local disk to the bucket.PHEW. The State of the bucket is now managed along with any future resources.

On the second and subsequent runs you use:

```sh
make build
```

## Features

This module implements state locking via DynamoDB, Versioning on files within the bucket and finally MFA Based deletes of the bucket itself.

The module also uses a tagging based on the map variable common_tags scheme.

This Scheme here uses as a minimum (in your terraform.tfvars):

```HCL
common_tags = {
  application = "terraform"
  module      = "statebucket"
  environment = "develop"
  authors     = "James Woolfenden, Oliver Smit"
}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:-----:|
| acl | Not Likely/Unwise to want a public state bucket, but here's the option | `string` | `"private"` | no |
| common\_tags | This is the common tags scheme map type for applying tags on resources | `map` | n/a | yes |
| force\_destroy | Set force\_destroy property - unlikely to anything else but may want rid of at some point | `bool` | `false` | no |
| versioning | Object to control version behaviour | `map` | <pre>{<br>  "enabled": true,<br>  "mfa_delete": true<br>}<br></pre> | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| bucket\_domain\_name | The FQDN for the bucket |
| statebucket | The state bucket details |
